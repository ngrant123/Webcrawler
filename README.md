# Webcrawler
Simple program that analyzes a HTML document

Created a simple program that if given a website link and a word
it would search throughout the html document and would return true if
the word was found or false if it was not found. The reason why I made this is to further get used to 
HTTP requests because the side project I'm currently working on requires it. In order to run this program 
you need to jave the jsoup library connecting to the project. After that its smooth sailing.
